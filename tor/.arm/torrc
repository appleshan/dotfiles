# This is a tor configuration made by arm. To change the configuration by hand
# edit this file then either...
# - tell arm to reset tor by pressing 'x'
# - run 'pkill -sighup tor'
# - or restart tor
#
# Descriptions of all of these configuration attributes (and many more) are
# available in the tor man page.

# The following flag tells arm to shut down tor when it quits.
# ARM_SHUTDOWN

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
DataDirectory /home/appleshan/.arm/tor_data # location to store runtime data

## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many log lines as
## you want.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
Log notice file /home/appleshan/.arm/tor_log # location to log notices, warnings, and errors
## Send only debug and info messages to /var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug-info file /var/log/tor/debug.log
## Send ONLY debug messages to /var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug-debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
## To use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles, uncomment these lines:
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line.

## Replace this with "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only as a
## server, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
#SocksBindAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
#SocksBindAddress 192.168.0.1:9100 # listen on a chosen IP/port too

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor controller
## applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.  NB: this feature is
## currently experimental.
ControlPort 9052              # port controllers can connect to
CookieAuthentication 1        # method for controller authentication

ClientOnly 1                  # prevents us from ever being used as a relay

# 前置的网络代理
Socks5Proxy 127.0.0.1:20089
